Notes for Instructor



1. Operating System Choice. While SLES-12 is a widely used operating system in corporate environments, I do not believe it's the best choice for this class. 

   ​	a. It's restrictive licensing prohibits software installation, which slows down progression through the course work.

   ​	b. It does not have any features covered in the coursework which are not available with openSUSE. And, if we stopped using YaST, we could use a distro which may have a shorter learning curve.

   ​	c. The Linux+ cert itself uses CentOS, and if students choose to obtain REHL certificates, CentOS is better introduction to linux.

   

2. Textbook choice. SUSE Linux Exterprise Server Administration is not the best textbook for the class.

   a. It's out-of-date.

   b. It's massive (5.5 lbs, 1000 pages)

   c. It doesn't have an electronic version

   d. Most certificates don't use it as source material.
